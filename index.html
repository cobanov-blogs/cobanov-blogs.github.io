                    <p> With over seven years of experience in fields such as
                        Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, I
                        possess a deep
                        understanding of the technical intricacies involved in
                        these areas. In addition, I have worked on various
                        projects utilizing large datasets
                        and AI models to create artistic works. I have had the
                        privilege of speaking at numerous events, where I have
                        shared my expertise with
                        others. My passion for these fields extends beyond my
                        professional experience and can be seen in my work as a
                        content creator on
                        platforms such as YouTube and Twitter.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I have created
                        open-source and free education projects, which have been
                        widely received by the
                        community. My drive and dedication to learning new
                        skills in this field is what keeps me motivated. I have
                        a constant desire to enhance
                        my knowledge and create innovative solutions. I am
                        confident that my experience, skills, and passion for
                        the field will make a valuable
                        contribution to any team.</p>

                    <p>I create artistic visuals with AI models using vast
                        amounts of data by training the AI models. Antilop is a
                        technology company that
                        combines the worlds of artificial intelligence and art.
                        As a data scientist and generative artist at Antilop, my
                        role is to create AI models
                        using data sets, train these models, and generate
                        artistic visuals, complex models are created using large
                        datasets, while in art, these
                        models are used to create artistic works.</p><br>

                    <p>During my tenure at a Swiss startup, I assumed the
                        leadership role of an Al team consisting of 5 members
                        and collaborated with cross-
                        functional teams to manage workflows. As a cohesive Al
                        team, we conceptualized and developed numerous Al and
                        Python courses from

                        inception to completion. Our team was responsible for
                        the successful delivery of eight diverse courses to a
                        massive audience of over
                        100,000 individuals.</p><br>

                    <p>In my capacity as a Data Scientist, I was entrusted with
                        overseeing the successful deployment of the Turkish
                        division of a data
                        warehouse established in Germany. Concurrently, I
                        spearheaded an end-to-end project aimed at mitigating
                        production errors by
                        performing a comprehensive analysis of data derived from
                        machines utilized in car injector production. This
                        initiative encompassed the
                        collection of data from measuring devices on the
                        production line, its subsequent storage, the development
                        of an XGBoost machine
                        learning model, and its reporting to a web page for
                        optimal end-user utilization. I also ensured the
                        encryption of data during the project
                        and addressed any potential security vulnerabilities.</p>

                    <p>My academic coursework primarily focused on software
                        development, signal processing, microprocessor design,
                        and communication
                        systems. I conducted research and implemented a
                        comparative analysis of conventional machine learning
                        techniques and of my project,
                        I leveraged Keras to develop a robust solution for
                        detecting Gaussian Noise in images, with an emphasis on
